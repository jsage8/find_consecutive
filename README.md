Find Consecutive
======================
Find all runs of an arbitrary length of consecutive numbers that increase or decrease by an
arbitrary step size. Return the start indices of the first element in each run. If there are no
consecutive runs, None will be returned.

To run this code import the method find_consecutive_runs from the module find_consecutive. To run
the unit tests on this code run `python find_consecutive_tests.py`.
